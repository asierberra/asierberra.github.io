## Sympathy for the reader

I, maybe like you, honestly have never liked predictions about what the future is gonna be. 
Perhaps relatedly, I don´t really like science-fiction. I believe that reality
tends to be in general much slower and much more boring than the expectations announce...
except on the few ocassions when it´s not...

And that´s precisely what this post is about: predictions about what the future is gonna be.


## Motivation

This is not about simply stupid doomsday announcements or confabulation theory stuff.
The motivation is simple: I´ve got two kids. I want to understand where they might be
living, in order to try to understand how to prepare best for that.

See, the thing is that up until recently (perhaps many people still believe this holds true), the 
recipe to raise a child in theory was rather simple: try to teach him/her values; try to
provide him/her education (ideally higher education); try to encourage certain soft skills
(networking, risk taking etc); and they were ready for the world. The "system" would 
provide for the rest: labor market, opportunities, consumer goods, stability, chances of
prosperity etc.

But I am starting the believe that things won´t be that simple soon...


## Lets start with the facts

The climate change is real. It is happening. And is probably accelerating.

On the other hand, we humans are not responding adequately. Middle classes (like me) because we are 
totally adicted to our lifestyle, and so are collectively incapable of changing gears. 
Poor people around the world, because they obviously are more worried about survival and providing
for their kids than on CO2. Western countries, because democracies are weak when it 
comes to imposing unpleasant measures on their citicens. Developping countries because
industrailisation was (so far) the only way out of generalized poverty.

With this, let´s think about what the future might look like...


## Direct effect of climate change

Heat: it appears that many regions (like around the equator) will get much warmer, and dryer. 

Rain: rain is expected to diminish in many places. In the extreme scenario (ref [1]), even clouds are
likely to dissapear due to extreme heat. 

Stability: extreme weather patters are said to be going to be much more violent and frequent.


## Indirect effects of climate change

When regions get so warm and dry as to become quite inhabitable (like perhaps around the equator),
the comunities in those regions either adapt, emigrate, or die.
Adaptation is probably often impossible for the many, except if there is a massive 
technological frog-leap, which sounds inprobable. Which means either mass emigration or 
mass death. Mass emigration is only possible if they are welcomed elsewhere, which
seems unlikely. Which leaves us with the prospect of massive deaths and population reduction.

When rain diminishes or dissapears, that means less water or no way water at all in many places. 
Which probably means reduced agriculture or much more expensive aggriculture (desalinated water?).
Which means less food. Which means not so many humans can exist.
Which leads again mass deaths and population reduction.

More unstable and violent weather events will cause more devastation. Weakened economies
can withstand those events badly, causing again many direct and indirect deaths.


## Pesimistic outlooks

We have already mentionned mass emigration and mass deaths due to inhabitability of some areas.
Also less water and less agriculture, which means fewer resources. Let´s see some 
logical follow-up ideas of that.

By the way, this agress pretty much with what Obama says in the Before the Flood
documentary [2]:

 > "A huge portion of the worl population lives near oceans. If they start moving,
    then you start seeing scarce resources. The subject of competition between
    populations. This is the reason why the Pentagon has said this is a national
    security issue; this isn´t just an environmental issue. [...] In very hard-headed
    terms you´ve got to worry about the national security implications of this and
    the capacity for the existing world order as we understand it to survive the
    kinds of strains that the scientists are predicting without action"


Militarization

Climate change will probably  cause massive polital instability.
Desperate people (understandably) won´t
obey rules. They will run for their lives. Which means governments might fall, caos might
take to many places, and in more and more strong authoritarian rulers will emerge.
Poeple will try to force into other regions of the world,
or start robbing massively (piracy, occupations of land or resources). Clashes between 
neighbouring contries will increase (water discupes, land disputes, survival).
Violence calls for violence, which means the world will get more militarized.


Economy

So the world will turn into survival mode. No more happy free-trade-based-world-order. Now
it will be about defending the homeland, defending the order, defening the resources.

And this new order will mean new lifestyle. Economies will turn into more like war-time economies,
where central states (when/where they still exist) will rule on very many aspects of economy
and peoples´ lifes. So the standard of living will change drastically: no more 
easy consumerism; less stuff available; just the basics.

This means that a huge fraction of the economy will be redundant or prohibited. "Useless" sectors
such as cosmetics, throw-way things, turism, decoration, fashion, etc, will be forced to srink hugely
or dissapear. Which could bring mass unemployment.

On the other hand, widespread instability and reduced resources will mean the global supply chains
might not be able to exist anymore. Economy (manufacturing) might become more local.
This brings back jobs to regions that can sustain them. But the raw-materials will 
be quite different so the capacity to manufacture many of the present consumer items
might be very different (like computer chips).

This new form of controlled-economy is perhaps the only way to impose dramatic 
cuotas or prohibitions on things
like CO2 emissions, deforestation, overconsumption etc in many places.


Political order

Democracies are sometimes rather weak. Some of them might survive the challenges 
(like UK did during the 2nd WW),
but many will not withstand. I cannot imagine for example my country, 
Spain, being too capable of surviving to social unrest. Which can only
be relaced by either by authoritarian leaders or caos.

Europe might either explode into again fragmented and atomic states, each one
surviving as they can with iron-wall borders.
Or alternatively perhaps Europe gets more united in face of the huge 
challenges ahead. Hostile neighbours and mass inmigration attempts probably help with the later.
But the key question maybe is what is europe´s capacity to feed itself.


Eco-terrorism and eco-wars

As the paranoia of climate change grows and if governments are
not taking action, there might appear a new form 
of eco-terrorism: violent action to blow infrastructure that is deemed
highly polluting. Either organized underground bands or perhaps countries
taking actions on against countries.

At some point, emissions must drastically reduce: this can only happen
throgh technology, or forcefully.


## Optimistic outlooks

The only ways in which we might be hope-full are:
 - there is a massive reduction in world population (perhaps due to new devastating diseases)
 - there is a fenomenal technology push
 - there is a radical change in lifestyle towards utter simplification and extrem minimalism

I dont believe the lifestyle change will happen by itself soon enough: more likely,
it will be imposed on the people by the facts and/or by strong rulers
when things are really bad (pesimistic scenarios above).

So the only realistic hope is technology. Ideally, we start focusing all of our resources
into reducing emisions. No more useless economy (like cosmetics); it is a war-effort
agains emissions. We must develop technology to reduce them at all cost. Nuclear,
storage, solar, recycling...

But we consumers and free-markets are responding too slowly, so it will have to be imposed: radical
taxes on some items; prohibitions; huge public investments in developping new infrastructure
which prevents emisions and also infrastructure that prepares us for the worst scenarios.
When will all this come? Soon


## So what to do

Perhaps climate change will be inconsequential. Perhaps nothing will happen.

But as Blaise Pascal argued on his wager [3]:

 > "Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. 
    If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), 
    whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in Heaven) and avoid infinite losses 
    (eternity in Hell).[2]"

We can argue likewise, that you need to be a fool to not prepare yourself for climate change: the 
loss in the event that it happens is too large.

It feels like we are approaching the same outcome as Easter Island [4]:
 > "By that time, 21 species of trees and all species of land birds became extinct through some 
 combination of over-harvesting, over-hunting, rat predation, and climate change. 
 The island was largely deforested, and it did not have any trees taller than 3 metres [...]
 As the island became overpopulated and resources diminished, warriors known as matatoa gained more power [...]
 fierce internal wars"

My gut feeling is that we will witness a bit of everything (both form the optimistic
as weel as the pesimistic scenarios). Probably we will not act soon enough (we are not doing
that yet, so why would we think that that´s gonna happen in the next few years?).
Which means that some parts of the world will go to shit.
There will be more wars and conflicts and militarims. Austerity will be inevitable.
The labor market will be vastly different from the current.
But hopefully some regions will
prevail and be able to focus their strenght and resources into developping new technology
that can make us transition into a world of 0 emissions and can make us survive the 
environment that we have created.

Even, depeding on the degree of desperations, big scale climate-engineering experiments might
begin. Their outcome is at least a bit uncertain and the chances of blowing it completely
exist, so I imagine those experiments only being taken as a last-resource bullet once
wverybody is convinced that everything is lost. But yet again, those things rely
on technology that needs to be developped and built.


## And what to teach

What to teach to our kids? The education system is very slow to adapt, and it will keep
teaching the old recipes for a long time. No need to worry about it.

Perhaps the most valuable knowledge in the mid-term future is something
like agriculture, or climate engineerign, or ultra-high-tech minimalist 
manufacturing.

But surely, the most important quality in this new world will be being strong.
